            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>As touching the matter in controuerſie, whereof in theſe dayes there is queſtion in the church: The ſaid Lord the King of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uarre</hi> deſireth, that conſideration may bee had, that hee is not the onely man; nor the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:16141:8"/>firſt, that hath complained of the abuſes brought into the church, and deſired refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the ſame: And therfore it ſhould bee too harde, that this moſt true Chriſtian deſire, to ſee the Church reformed, ſhould be imputed vnto him as hereſie, or enimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie againſt the ſame: In that for the ſpace of fiue hundred yeares and aboue, it hath bene a common complaint of all Princes, of all learned men, and of all holy perſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nages, that the Churche through all this long tract of tyme, hath loſt much of her firſt puritie and ſinceritie, for ſhee being thus compounded of men, who without doubt, euer with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues added &amp; brought ſome what of their owne inuentions vnto her. So that it hath bene the voyce of all Councelles (without exception of any) which haue béene holden within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe of the time aforeſaid that the Church had great néede of reformation, which in euery age hath béene long deſired, yea, and vehemently ſighed for, by all the beſt ſort of men, out of whoſe mouthes this ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence would neuer elſe haue procéeded: to witte, that whoſoeuer ſhould affirme the Church to haue néede of purging, ought to
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:16141:8"/>be taken for an heretike, and enimie of the ſame, That the moſt Chriſtian Kings well perceauing the ſame, haue often for the like effect thought it to appertaine to their of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, and toward the diſcharge of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, to exhort the Pope and Chriſtian Princes to a generall Councell, which in the Popes default, and in caſe hee winked at the matter, they could very well take vppon them to call together by their owne authoritie, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whence haue proceeded vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their owne names, moſt laudable or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dynaunces, for the reformation of the french Church. So that, in the ende after long complaint of many ages, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they, to whome the matter ſeemed to appertaine, would not take in hande, but rather (as all men know) imployed themſelues in the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires of the worlde, it came to paſſe, that many Princes, Peoples, and eſtates, with great care weying and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſidering the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons alledged vnto them, and ſeeing the defence and maintenaunce of the ſame, by the great conſtancie of infinite Parſons of all degrées, in moſt gréeuous torments, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen vnto th'extremitie of death: did remit the ſaid reformation to a lawful Councell,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:16141:9"/>and vpon refuſall of the ſame, did proteſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the abuſes, which they pretented to be in the Churche: and thereunto did laye their owne helping hande to redreſſe the ſame: from whence ſprang the Schiſme, which the ſaide Lord the King of <hi>Nauarre</hi> doth nowe bewaile to ſee in the Chriſtian Church, and againſt the which it was not vnpoſſible in ſo long tyme to find remedie, if the honour of God, and the ſaluation of men had touched vs as neere, as our owne glorie or particular profit.</p>
            <p>The ſayd King of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> in regard of him ſelfe, ſaith, that he was not only borne during this vnhappy Schiſme, that thus hath happened in the Chriſtian Churche, (the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinuance whereof, he iudgeth, ought to be imputed to ſuch, as ſought not means to revnite the Churche as they ought to haue done) but alſo that hee was brought vp in <hi>Fraunce,</hi> while th'exerciſe of both the Religions was permitted by the King, in the generall eſtates of his Realme, and after confirmed by many of his Maieſties Edictes: beſides, he was nouriſhed and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed in his tender years in this beliefe, that there were great abuſes in the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine

            <p>As for the counſel of Trent, it is not to be obeyed. For although the continuance there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of was proſecuted by the late king Charles, and in the ende obteyned at the handes of Pope <hi>Paulus</hi> the thirde, and after the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clayming thereof, Ambaſſadores were ſent from his maieſtie to the ſame counſell with Chriſtian and Catholike inſtructions, agrée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the holy decres of the romiſh church, and approued by the Colledg, of <hi>Sorbonne,</hi> and the Doctors of the ſame, ſent to the ſaid counſell with the ſayd Ambaſſadors: Yet not withſtanding all their diligence vſed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the Cardinales, Legates, and preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentes in the ſaide Counſell, by the ſpace of eightéene Monethes and aboue, it was not poſſible to obteyne any thing conformable to the ſaide inſtructions, nor to reforme the eccleſiaſticall order according to the ſame. When his maieſtie was aduertiſed therof, and well perceiuing the harmes that might growe thereby: he gaue commaundement
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:16141:10"/>to his Ambaſſadores, to proteſt agaynſt the ſayd Counſell, and after their proteſtation made, to come home from thence, and ſo they did accordingly. And albeit great ſuite and intreatie was made vnto them, by the Pope and the ſayd Cardinales, and the deceaſed Cardinall of <hi>Loraine,</hi> to returne to the ſaid counſell, and ſtay there tyll the ende of the ſame: yet they would neuer yéeld ſo to doo. So that the ſame counſell was continued, ended, and concluded without them, &amp; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out their ſignet, according to the cuſtome of all times. Wherby alſo it came to paſſe, that for any inſtant purſuit that was made, for the receyuing and publiſhyng of the ſame counſell, in the Court of Parliament at <hi>Paris,</hi> the ſaid Court, the Chambers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aſſembled, hath alwaies withſtoode it, and that in the yeere thréeſcore and twelue, after Bartholmeweday, when the ſame ſée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med greatly to fauour their ſuite.</p>
            <p>Therfore the ſaid King of <hi>Nauarre</hi> think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that men of vpright iudgement, cannot accompt him either an heretique or an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate perſon, conſidering the matter is yet vndiſcided and in reſpect he ſubmitteth him ſelfe to the triall of a counſell, neither can

On the contrary ſide he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>playneth, that hitherto for the ſpace of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie yéeres, he hath ſéene theſe zealous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons aſſembled to deſtroy him, but not to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct him. He complayneth of a proceſſe: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gynning with execution, of a teaching, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gunne with excommunication, without any kind of formalitie that eyther is requiſit, or may be allowed to procéede. Proteſting be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore al Princes and eſtates, and aboue all others, before the King his Soueraigne Lorde, to whom he maketh his recourſe for iuſtice, &amp; before the eſtate of this kingdom, vnto whom he intendeth to repreſent his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, againſt the aucthors and fauters of this league, of ſo manyfeſt violence, precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:16141:11"/>and iniuſtice.</p>
            <p>The ſaid King of <hi>Nauarre</hi> alſo affirmeth, that the name &amp; blame of a relaps or a back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlider, cannot rightly be applied vnto him, by vertue whereof, (though by a counſell he ſhoulde yeelde to chaunge his opinion) theyr pretence is to depriue him from the ſucceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Crowne, whereon God graunt they thinke as litle as he. And therby he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferreth the cauſe to all mens vpright conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, to thinke with what charitie his aduerſaries procéede herein. And whereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their deuiſe may tend, to cut from him (aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as lieth in their power) the deſire to procure his inſtruction in a counfell, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out entring into the depth that might ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwe it, both by Cannons, and examples. In their language, they call them Relapſes or backſliders, that haue been heretiques and abiured there hereſies, and yet neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theles after wards fall into the ſame againe. Therefore foraſmuch as the King of <hi>Nauar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re</hi> (as here aboue appeareth) hath not by the Cannons been an heretique: it is moſt cléere that he cannot be a relaps. He further affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth, that though he had been, or ſhoulde be an heretique, yet could he not be a relaps,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:16141:12"/>conſidering he was neuer conuerted fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the pretended hereſie, and conſidering alſo, that no one euer thought to take any payne, or ſeeke meanes howe to perſwade or conuert him, but theſe zealous fellowes haue ſhot at no other marke, with all their driftes and endeuours, then to ouerthrowe and deſtroy him.</p>
            <p>They alledge here, that the ſaid Lord the King of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> after Bartholmewe day, ſent to the Pope, and yéelded to goe to maſſe, Setting age aſid, euery man knoweth what kinde of conuerſion this was, and whether he had iuſt cauſe of ſcare or not, lenger refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation would be friuolous. The truth is, if, by all lawes, our actions are accompted of no force, when they procéede through feare or force: it is moſt certaine, that neuer had action leſſe will, neither euer had any acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on more force. The truth is alſo, that he had not ſo ſoone recouered his will, but he cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſhe ſame to appeare by publique profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, what it was, and that in the middeſt of the Catholiques which were in his cempa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, and ſeemed to poſſeſſe him at that time: without either diſſimulation or ſubtillie, whereby his errour might appeare to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:16141:12"/>farre from hippocrfle.</p>
            <p>The ſaide Lord the King of <hi>Nauarre</hi> moſt humbly beſéecheth the King his Lord, that it would pleaſe him to take in good parte, his modeſt anſwere alſo, to that blame whiche they lay to his charge, that he is a perſecuter of the Catholique Church. And touching this poynte, he citeth the conſciences of his greateſt enimies to anſwere before God, whether this title in any reſpecte can ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaine vnto him. Let euery man here con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, that the ciuill warres ſel in the tender yéeres of the ſaid King of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there be any likelyhood, that he enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed warre with a ioyfull hart perſecute the Catholikes, euery man knowing their number, aucthoritie, and force in this king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, to be wholy without and frée from perſecution: Who vnder the kinges onely name were in ſafetie, in regard of the ſayde King of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> and of all that dependeth on him, from all attemptes, enterpriſes and iniuries whatſoeuer. Verily there haue ben rigours and perſecutions heard, and ſpoken of in Fraunce, within the ſpace of certaine yéeres paſſed: But no man at any time in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted them other wiſe then paſſiuelie, in
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:16141:13"/>regard of them of the religion, and aniuely in regard of others. And to vſe any woord to the contrary, would be ſo vnantly ſpoken, that no man would vnderſtand it.</p>
            <p>It pleaſed King Charles, to cauſe the ſaid King of <hi>Nauarre</hi> repayre to his Coart, and to honour him with Marriage of his ſiſter. He came thither in the religion wherein he was brought vp: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And yet without doubt he had greater occaſion then any other, either to beare ſome ſtomacke for matters paſſed, or to be as it were recompenced for the loſſes he ſuffered.

And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo <hi>Mounſier</hi> the Marſhall of <hi>Biron,</hi> my L. the Archbiſhop of <hi>Vienna, Mounſir de Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leroy,</hi> ſecretary of eſtate to his Maieſtie, and many others, that were beholders of it vpon the places, can giue teſtimony of the ſame.</p>
            <p>As ſoone as liberty of conſcience was gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, albeit with very great reſtraint in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of the former edict, he vnarmde him ſelfe without delay, though (as hys Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie beſt of all others knoweth) hee coulde haue continued the warres with greater power and meanes, by reaſon of the notable ayde which hee had procured from the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of hys religion, béeing ſo farre for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde, that a ſtrong Armye of ſtraungers
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:16141:15"/>was at the poynt of entring into this king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome: thinking himſelfe happy to haue diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched the ſame away, in ſort, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> poore people by occaſion thereof might ſuffer no farther inconuenience: chooſing rather by ſuccouring them, to impayre his owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, then to better it with theyr hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunce. Wherefore the ſayd Lorde y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> King of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> prayeth all men freely to ſpeake theyr mindes, whether hee hath in any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect by his demencures, deſcrued the name of a perſecutor, which his enimies attribute vnto him, that would not take this reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to ſuffer them goe forwarde with the execution of theyr barbarous perſecutions and bloudie deuiſes, againſt him at the firſt ſhewe, but conſequently againſt y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Kinges Maieſty and his royall eſtate.</p>
            <p>In thoſe Countries where the ſaide King of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> by the grace of God, hath ſouc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne power and authority, he thinketh al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to haue as little deſerued this blame in the iudgement of them y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> haue well knowne the nature of matters, and the order of his procéedinges: And in all that remaineth to him of the kingdome of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> where at his comming to hys dignity, he founde the
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:16141:16"/>exerciſe of the Catholique Romiſh religion, it is moſt certeyne, that he hath neither al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered nor innouated any thing therein, in ſo much that the ſeruice of the ſame is there ſtil vſed at this day, without any exerciſe of the reformed religion, ſauing in two places onely.</p>
            <p>And as touching his countrie of <hi>Bearne,</hi> which is no great land, the Quéene his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in a generall aſſemblie of the eſtates, did there eſtabliſh the ſaid religion, whereof her ſelfe made profeſſion, and no complaynt of the chaung of religion followed thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon to the ſaid eſtates, in the ſpace of many yéeres after it had continued in the ſame eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate, as he hath alredie fréely declared, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing alwaies been of this opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>créet and well counſeiled Prince, without great neceſſitie or euident profit, ought not to bring any chaunge into his eſtate. And though commoditie or neceſſitie ſhoulde re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire the ſame, yet it were expedient that it ſhoulde be accompliſhed by the like waye, whereby the conſtitution was before made.</p>
            <p>Nowe he had well pérceiued, that after
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:16141:16"/>Bartholmew day, when him ſelfe, by force and violence, had yéelded in the cauſe of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and ſent <hi>Monſir de Mieuſſent</hi> for go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernour and Liuetenant generall, into his ſayde Countrie of <hi>Bearne</hi> (whom all men knowe to be a Catholique) with expreſſe commiſſion there to ſet up agayne, the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique Romiſhe religion: Yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the great diſpayre that then was of the affayres of religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in Fraunce, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the contrary profeſſion of him ſelfe, which might ſerue for an example to his ſubiectes, and notwithſtanding the auc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie of a gouernour by him expreſſly ſent, they did all reſolue to perſeuer in their religion, and maintaine the forme of their eſtate, without receiuing the ſaid alteration in religion.</p>
            <p>Wherefore the ſayde King of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> thought and let al men indge whether without good reaſon or not) that it was a firme and well grounded reſolution of his eſtats, foraſmuch as neceſſity, yea &amp; that ſuch neceſſitie, as giueth law to al laws, was not in any wiſe able to remoue them from it. Alſo it is moſt true, that in the aſſemblies of the eſtaes which are from yéere too yéere
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:16141:17"/>holden in his ſaid countrie of Bearne, there neuer appeared any man that required this change of religion, though, (as it is well knowen, there is ſuche libertie vſed in thoſe aſſemblies, that the leaſt griefe pretended to haue béen rereiued from the Prince, may be propounded with requeſt of reformation and recompence, whereby it appeareth to be afore any practiſe, of the enufers of the tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quilitie of his ſubiectes, and not an in warde deſire of them. And yet for all that, the ſayde Lord the king of <hi>Nauarre</hi> hath not ceaſed, to make continual payment of the pentions of the Prelats, and other Eccleſiaſtical per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of his ſaid countrie, (for proofe wherof, he will bring foorth no other witneſſes but them ſelues) and that moſt often with his owne proper money, as the biſhops of <hi>Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques</hi> and <hi>Oleron,</hi> and others well knowe.

And héereof the Catholiques of <hi>Bearne</hi> are witneſſes, who there liue, in all peace and tranquillity.

And therefore the ſayd Lord the King of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes noted thys, that he hath béene as faithfully ſerued by the one, as the other: As for example, in the deſtribution of the offices of his houſe, all men knowe well enough, he hath indifferently furniſhed them with both ſortes of men. Alſo the ſayd Lord, the King of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> knoweth himſelfe to be well beloued, and faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

And further, it is not vnknown to the Lords, Gentlemen, and all other Catholiques, that during the time of the troubles, he ſpared them as much as hee coulde in theyr goods and houſes, neuer ſuffering anie rigour of warre to be vſed to them, no not ſo much as againſt hys owne Vaſſalles that roſe in Armes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt hym, and were preſent at the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying of his proper houſes, who not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, after the warres were ended, making their repayre vnto hym, were all welcome to his preſence, and neuer receyued for theyr diſloyall doings ſo much as an euill word, or angry coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenaunce at his handes.

Which to him paraduenture were no hard chaunge, if he had as litle religion in him as the aduerſaries haue, whether alſo he euer delayed y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> receiuing of peace, for any particuler occaſion whatſoeuer, (albeit his degrée is ſuche, as that which to him is particular, might rightly be iudged for publique) when his conſcience might be ſatiſfied, and could ſee that the profeſſors of the ſame religion which he profeſſeth, might ſerue God according to their fayth, in tranquilitie and quietnes: Whether he euer demaunded any thing gaynefull to him ſelfe, encreaſe of auctho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, encreaſe of pencions, or encreaſe of offices: Whether contrariwiſe, he hath not rather choſen, to ſee him ſelfe as he is, without aucthoritie in his gouerneme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t which by the peace ought to be al yéelded into his handes, then to prolong the war neuer ſo little, then by the ſpace of ſo much as an houre, to delaye the comfort and ſuccour of the people, by the peace, or to trouble the peace after it was made, for default of enioying that which was promiſed in his regarde. The articles of
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:16141:34"/>the laſt peace may be for witneſſes, and the conference of <hi>Flex,</hi> wherein he might fitly haue ſerued his owne turne to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large his conditions, by reaſon of the great deſire which <hi>Mounſir</hi> that is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſſed, had to paſſe into the Low Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, whether he was called by a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Ambaſſage of the eſtates of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trye, who moſt inſtantly required and ſollicited him to come thyther. Yet the King of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> at that time rather yéelded away his owne intrreſt to the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uauncement of this kingdome, then he would neuer ſo little, differ or ſtande to make merchandiſe of a benefite as might thereby come to his partie. Therefore he made peace, and accepted it with ſuche conditions as pleaſed his maieſtie to graunte, to the intent too further the conqueſt of thoſe countries, and to tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port him ſelfe thither in perſon, yf it might ſo ſtande with his maieſties fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and good liking. Theſe good French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men the heades of the league, to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peach the ioyning of <hi>Flaunders</hi> to <hi>Fraunce,</hi> when the Ambaſſadoures of the Low Countryes offered it to the King, with ſuch conditions as that they were

            <p>What pacience the King of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> hath vſed in all that time, notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the diſcontentment that he might conceiue by the dealing which at the ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion, of ſuch as be like to the aduerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, vſed toward hym, I leaue it to the conſideration of all the worlde, beyng ſeperated from the King, without auc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie in his gouernement, not payed of that whiche was due vnto him, and much leſſe reſpected in his affayres, then the leaſt Captayne of the kingdome. Be it ſpoken without reproche.</p>
            <p>And to vtter the plaine truthe of his demeanours. If he had béen no more touched with the féelyng and conſideration of the griefe and detry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the people, and of all Fraunce, then they of the league bee at
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:16141:35"/>thys day, béeing that partye which hee is: both people and Country myght haue fallen into vtter deſtruction. But hee is a Frenchman, and a French Prince, a number of Fraunce, and fée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth her gréeſes and woundes.</p>
            <p>Diminiſhing of authority, want of fauour, particular intereſt, hadde neuer the power to make hym rage and ſpight agayuſt hymſelfe, whyth is a thing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to the Leaguers, who are but light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly graſted in Fraunce, and are lyke to wodden legges, and tymber Armes, that féele nothing when the body is bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. To which kinde of men, may bee eaſily gyuen the outward parte, but not the inwarde affection, neyther the moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing or féeling of a true and naturall Frenchman.</p>
            <p>Touching theſe broyles and commoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, whych they declare and proteſt to bee directly againſt him, bending themſelues agayuſt hys perſon, his lyſe, hys honour, hys conſcience, ſéeing them armed, and and taking Townes in the myddeſt of hys Gouernment, béeing on euery ſide compaſſed and encombred by them, his pacience inceſſantly ſtyrred and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Here is the whole ſomme of al things, whereby the Kyng of <hi>Nauarre</hi> canne be blamed with theſe fayre tyrles of here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique, Relaps, perſecutor of the Church, enemie of the Catholiques, and diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of this eſtate.

            <p>This certainly is the poynt y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> moſt of all others ſticketh in theyr harts, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:16141:36"/>the ſayd King of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> hath he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto thought leaſt, and nowe laſt of all it is preſented to him. Touching this: point, the ſaid Lord the King of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> contenteth himſelfe, in hope that God will long preſerue life to the Kings Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie, for the benefit and common wealth of thys Realme, and graunt him iſſue in due time; to the great gréefe of all his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies. Hys confidence alſo is, that hee hath to doo with Frenchmen, notwyth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, al the care and dilligence that hath béene vſed to corrupt them, who know the rights, are not ignoraunt of the diſcentos, and will maintaine him in the place and degrée which he ought to hold.

            <p>For concluſion, and as concerning re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, the ſaid Lord the King of <hi>Nauarre</hi> declareth to the King hys ſoueraigne Lorde, to all orders and eſtates of thys Realme, and to all Princes and eſtates

            <p>And foraſmuch as they of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſaid league haue taken the ſaid King of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> for the matter &amp; pretence of theyr ryſing in Armes, I would haue all men think, that their quarrell is onely againſt him, &amp; no man els, ſowing diuers ſlaunders abroad
